This source code is from the former web mashup map.talleye.com.

It includes the source code of:
* If I walk in a straight line around the world, where will I pass?
** choose where to pass
** choose your direction
* If I dig a very deep hole, where will I end up?

I decided to shutdown the service and the hosting, I don't have time to do maintenances anymore.
